# Aircraft Tracking and FM Radio Signal Monitoring with RTL-SDR

## Overview
This project leverages RTL-SDR to intercept and decode ADS-B signals for aircraft tracking and to monitor FM radio signal clarity. Using RTL-SDR hardware and software, the goal is to assess the availability of aircraft in a specific region and evaluate FM radio signal clarity.

## Objectives
- Track aircraft using ADS-B signals.
- Monitor FM radio signal clarity.

## Tools and Materials
### Hardware
- RTL-SDR Blog V4 R828D RTL2832U 1PPM TCXO HF Bias Tee SMA Dongle
- Multipurpose Dipole Antenna Kit

### Software
- AIRSPY SDR# Studio v1.0.0.1919
- Virtual Radar Server (for additional aircraft tracking)
- Jetvision (ADS-B, RTL1090) (for signal monitoring)

## Methodology
1. **Setup RTL-SDR Hardware & Software:**
   - Configure the RTL-SDR dongle to receive signals in the 1090 MHz frequency range.
   - Set up software for decoding ADS-B signals.

2. **Antenna Configuration:**
   - Utilize a dipole antenna tuned to 1090 MHz for optimal signal reception.

3. **Signal Monitoring:**
   - Monitor ADS-B signals for aircraft tracking.
   - Fine-tune settings to optimize reception and tracking accuracy.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Use mapping software to visualize aircraft positions and monitor FM radio signals.
